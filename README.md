# 2D Physics Collision Sandbox

A web-based 2D physics sandbox where users can spawn objects, make them collide, and observe realistic physics interactions.

## Current Features (v0.1)

- Basic scene setup with Matter.js physics engine
- Spawn boxes by clicking anywhere in the canvas
- Physics boundaries (floor, walls, ceiling)
- Responsive design (adapts to window size)

## Upcoming Features

- Object inventory with different shapes (circles, triangles, polygons)
- Material selection (glass, wood, stone, rubber, metal)
- Size selection options
- Fracturing/breaking physics on collision
- Time control (pause, reverse, slow motion)
- Gravity toggle
- Object deletion

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Matter.js Physics Engine

## How to Use

1. Open the web page
2. Click anywhere on the screen to spawn a box
3. Watch the physics interactions

## Project Status

This project is in early development following the roadmap in the PRD.
